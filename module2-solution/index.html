        <section id="sec3" class="title">Caipirinha</section>
        <p>Brazil's national cocktail made with cachaça (sugar cane hard liquor), sugar and lime.
          Cachaça is Brazil's most common distilled alcoholic beverage (also known as Pinga or Caninha).
          Both rum and cachaça are made from sugarcane-derived products. Specifically with cachaça,
          the alcohol results from the fermentation of sugarcane juice which is then distilled.</p>
